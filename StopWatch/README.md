Start , pause and stop does their usual work. Also when stop is pressed a log is stored which can be checked by clicking on log button.<br>

P.S: still working on making log work dynamically on every machine, currently works fine for me but you might have to check the path for the log file. It's suggestedfor writing log that you add 'log.txt' in the same directory as program file while for read you can change line:161 to the same log file.
